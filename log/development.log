AbstractController::DoubleRenderError - Render and/or redirect were called multiple times in this action. Please note that you may only call render OR redirect, and at most once per action. Also note that neither redirect nor render terminate execution of the action, so if you want to exit an action after redirecting, you need to do something like "redirect_to(...) and return".:

Mongoid::Errors::NestedAttributesMetadataNotFound - 
Problem:
  Could not find metadata for relation 'idea' on model: User.
Summary:
  When defining nested attributes for a relation, Mongoid needs to access the metadata for the relation 'idea' in order if add autosave functionality to it, if applicable. Either no relation named 'idea' could be found, or the relation had not been defined yet.
Resolution:
  Make sure that there is a relation defined named 'idea' on User or that the relation definition comes before the accepts_nested_attributes_for macro in the model - order matters so that Mongoid has access to the metadata.

 Example:
   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
     has_many :albums
     accepts_nested_attributes_for :albums
   end
